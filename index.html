Although the existing methods, that use deep generative models to infer the missing content, produce realistic images, sometimes the results are unsatisfactory due to arithmetical issues caused by the use of unbalanced ingredients of the proposed cost functions. In this paper, we propose a loss that generates more plausible results. Experiments on two datasets show that our method predicts information in large missing regions and achieves pixel-level photorealism, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods [24] and [25]. Having improved the semantic image inpainting we focus on applying the method to laparoscopic images that suffer from glares. The modified technique again outperforms its rivals. Moreover, it is faster than classical PDE based inpainting techniques and, more importantly, its running time is almost independent on the size of missing area, both critical issues in medical image processing.","url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-40605-9_38"}],"skills":[{"name":".NET Core","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":".NET Framework","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Agile Methodologies","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Amazon Web Services (AWS)","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Apache Kafka","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"C","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"C#","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"C++","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Computer Vision","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Critical Thinking","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Digital Image Processing","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Digital Signal Processing","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Elasticsearch","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Git","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Grafana","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"gRPC","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Hibernate","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"InfluxDB","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Infrastructure as code (IaC)","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Java","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"JavaScript","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Jenkins","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Kubernetes","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Legacy Systems","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Linux","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MariaDB","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MetaTrader","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Microservices","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MongoDB","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MVC","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MySQL","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"NewRelic","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"NoSQL","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Oracle Database","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"PostgreSQL","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Protocol Buffers","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Python","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"React.js","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Reactive Programming","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Redis","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Software Development","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Spring Boot","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Spring DI","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Spring Framework","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Test Driven Development","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"TypeScript","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Web Applications","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Web Development","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Web Technologies","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"WildFly","level":"","keywords":[]}],"languages":[{"fluency":"Elementary","language":"English"},{"fluency":"Native Speaker","language":"Greek"},{"fluency":"Native Speaker","language":"Italian"}],"interests":[],"references":[],"projects":[],"meta":{"version":"v1.0.0","canonical":"https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/blob/v1.0.0/schema.json"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"78tYpEdCsaChrBtnx7TaV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
